# Project ARID

ARID is an open-source cross-platform application built using React Native, and Expo. The word 'ARID' being synonym of 'DRY', is aptly named; as the application helps users to find out if it is a 'dry day' today in their respective state. The application also hosts a built-in calender which users can scroll/swipe to check-out dry day dates before or after current date.
